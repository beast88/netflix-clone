# Netflix Clone

## Project Overview

### Description

I decided to build a Netflix clone using React JS using both compound components and styled components.

Compound components are something that I recently discovered and I'm excited to build a project using them.

## Development

### Technologies

#### Frontend

- React JS
- normalize.js - makes the browser render elements in a consistent way
